# Likelihood-of-H1B-Visa-Approval

Introduction - Learning the Domain:
The US H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. A specialty occupation requires a specialized knowledge and a bachelor's degree or equivalent work experience in areas such as information technology (IT), finance, accounting, architecture, engineering, mathematics, science, medicine, etc. A LCA (Labor Condition Application) is a mandatory document that the H1B Sponsor / employer needs to file with US Department of Labor before they file the H1B petition with USCIS for any non-immigrant worker.

Framing the Problem:
For a foreign national to apply for H1-B visa, a US employer must offer them a job and submit a petition for H-1B visa to the US immigration department. This is also the most common visa status applied for and held by international students once they complete college or higher education and begin working in a full-time position. A LCA (Labor Condition Application) is a mandatory document that the H1B Sponsor/employer needs to file with US Department of Labor before they file the H1B petition with USCIS for any non-immigrant worker. This form has all the key information regarding the offered job, wage details, location, etc. that is offered to the foreign worker. This application needs to be certified in order to get the H1B visa approved.
It is very important for an employer and employee to know if the LCA application will be approved/ certified for visa. Through this project, a definite answer to this question will be predicted.
